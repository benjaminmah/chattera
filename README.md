# Chattera
Chattera is a real-time multi-user messaging platform with Google account creation. Created using React.js, CSS, and Firebase.

Deployed version can be found at: chattera.netlify.app

Note: If you are unable to view the chats after logging in with Google, that is most likely an issue with Firebase. I am currently fixing it up so it can be deployed once again!
